Hi,

Thanks for checking out my website. You can view the site at: https://danielsimunov.github.io/dailygrind-project/

I designed the site in figma, then coded it in VS code. Here's a link to view the design in figma: https://www.figma.com/file/T55Sqr1a5OrP00jq5Ajc3j/daily-grind?node-id=0%3A1

I created the logo and some of the icons.

As of 24/10/2021, the website is currently a work in progress. I decided to upload the site at the current state to showcase a bit of my work for jobs I'll be applying to!

If you have any feedback, please let me know your thoughts!

Thanks!
